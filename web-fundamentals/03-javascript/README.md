# JavaScript Folder Guide

Your main focus: control flow → fundamentals → DOM → advanced → async.

## Order
1. control-flow.js — Loops (for, while, for...of) & conditionals (if/else, switch)
2. fundamentals.js — Variables, functions, scope/closures, arrays/objects
3. dom-manipulation.js — Select/update DOM, events, delegation, storage
4. advanced-concepts.js — Prototypes, classes, this, generators, Proxy
5. async-advanced.js — Event loop, callbacks, promises, async/await, fetch

## Outcomes
- Strong foundation in core JS and DOM APIs
- Confident with advanced language features
- Deep understanding of the event loop and async patterns
