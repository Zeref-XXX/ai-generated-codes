# TypeScript Folder Guide

Your second focus: types, generics, and real-world utilities.

> Before coding TypeScript, see the setup guide: [../TYPESCRIPT_SETUP_GUIDE.md](../TYPESCRIPT_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

## Order
1. fundamentals.ts — Types, interfaces vs types, classes, generics, guards
2. control-flow.ts — Type-safe loops, conditionals, discriminated unions, type narrowing
3. advanced-patterns.ts — Conditional/mapped types, infer, recursive patterns
4. type-utilities.ts — 16 built-in utilities + 15+ custom utilities

## Outcomes
- Type any JavaScript confidently
- Create advanced generic utilities
- Read and write production-grade TypeScript
